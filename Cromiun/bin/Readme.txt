All the demos will create the EXEs in this directory.

By default, all demos need to find the CEF binaries in the same directory as the EXE.
In that case, you have to copy the contents of the Release and Resources directories here.

The SubProcess demo *MUST* have the SimpleBrowser.exe, subprocess.exe and crash_reporter.cfg files in this directory.
